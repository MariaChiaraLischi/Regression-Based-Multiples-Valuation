This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Evidence based Decisions using Big Data Analytics during the exchange at Technische Universität München as part of the Master’s degree program in Finance at Luiss Guido Carli University.

The project aims to estimate the enterprise value of private companies using valuation multiples, addressing the challenge posed by the absence of market prices. The methodologies applied include simple and multiple linear regressions, as well as seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), to identify key value drivers and assess the validity of multiples across industries. The analysis accounts for potential industry heterogeneity to ensure robustness in the valuation approach.
